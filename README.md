# odesolve

This repo contains 2 files: odesolve.py, which is used to define the functions to solve ODEs using both the euler method and Runge Kutta 4. The second file: test_odesolve.py, is used to run these functions to pass a series of tests to check that the ODE solvers work for different given scenarios.

To run this file, run test_odesolve.py, which will call upon the functions defined in odesolve.py
